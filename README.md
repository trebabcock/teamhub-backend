# Teamhub

Teamhub is (or will be) a place for teams to collaborate and share ideas. This is absolutely still a work in progress. There's still a ways to go before I have an MVP.

The backend is much more mature than the client, but it's also a bit easier to develop. I still need to implement authentication and middleware, and I have a few handlers that I need to write. But my main focus is getting the client further along. Feel free to submit a PR if you can navigate my mostly undocumented code.
